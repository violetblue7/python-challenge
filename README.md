# python-challenge

Learning about Python was an eye opening experience, now I understand the resistance that the industry has on VBA. Python's funtionality using csv reader, encoding "UTF-8", casting integers, f-string method, working thru lists and dictionaries. Making the process flow understable. 

Functions and transactions used in the exercices:
Conditionals (if)
Logic tests (<>, ==)
Keys and values
List methods: append, index and len
Interate over the data, use loops (while).
